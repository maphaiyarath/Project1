## Description
This project entailed creating a web application with usage of of two APIs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery. The app had to be user friendly and with localStorage. Our group created a web application that helps users find a local radio station when he/she are in a differenct city. It also allows the user to listen to any radio station across the U.S.

You may need to go to your site settings and allow insecure content for the radio streaming URLs to go through.

The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/gsmac14/Project1).
